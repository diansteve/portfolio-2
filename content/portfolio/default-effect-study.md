#### What it is:  
* An experimental study to contribute to behavioral nudge theory 
* The default effect overpowers individual choice 
  + Even when decision-makers are aware of the presence of defaults
* Literature suggests testing the impact of transparency on defaults
* Our study: can transparent justifications for defaults impact renewable energy adoption?

#### What I did:  
* Reviewed literature on behavioral nudging and the default effect
* Created experimental design to test hypothesis correctly 
* Conducted power analysis to determine subjects needed 
* Developed pre-screen and survey tools to test hypothesis
* Submitted IRB proposal and revised until accepted
* Administered survey online to subject pool
* Analyzed data to test hypotheses on outcome measures
* Presented findings at [**2018 AMA ICC**](https://www.ama.org/events/2019-ama-international-collegiate-conference/) and [**local**](https://sites.psu.edu/psichi/) [**conferences**](https://undergradresearch.psu.edu/resources/opportunities/undergraduate-exhibition)
* Won third place at 2018 AMA ICC representing Penn State 

#### What I learned:  
* Experimental Design
  + Power Analysis 
  + Factorial Design
  + Survey Design
  + Subject assignment and measurement 
* Data Analysis 
  + SPSS
  + Hypothesis testing
  + Variable interactions
* Scientific Communication
  + Poster design
  + Conference presentation

#### Why it interests me:  
* Choice architecture has a powerful impact on decision-making 
* Defaults can promote good or bad decisions but can't be ignored 
* We need to consider its influence, especially when developing policy
  + It is amoral to ignore defaults when giving people choices
  + Moral leadership is needed to protect vulnerable populations
* It can be used to challenge defaults when people make decisions
  + Fossil fuel energy is the default in most architectures
  + Can renewables be adopted more by making them the default?
