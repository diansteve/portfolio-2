#### What it is:  
* A tool for nonprofit organizations in Baltimore City

* Allow for more effective collaboration and resource allocation

#### What I did:  
* Developed interactive visualizations for user exploration
* Prioritized feature development for Minimum Viable Product  
* Built and deployed a Shiny web application

#### What I learned:  
* Web Development  
  + Shiny
  + Bootstrap
  + Reactive programming
  + Front-end design
* Web Mapping

  + Google Maps Platform API
  + Map projections and transformations

#### Why it interests me:
