#### What it is:  
* A minimal Express.js app to replace my R Markdown blog with more flexibility
* A platform for engaging visualization techniques like scrollytelling

#### What I did:  
* Created a minimal Express.js application
* Emulated my existing R Markdown blog and its Distill.pub theme 
* Built scrollytelling layouts to make maps and charts more engaging
* Deployed on AWS in an automated CI/CD pipeline

#### What I learned:  
* PaaS
  + AWS ElasticBeanstalk
  + AWS CodePipeline
* Webdev
  + Node.js
  + Express.js
  + Jade Templating Engine
* Visualization
  + Scrollama.js
  + Deck.gl
  + Plotly.js

#### Why it interests me:  
* I have very clear ideas of how I want to display my data and can not always accomplish that with R alone
* Engaging publications like The Pudding & NYT Interactive have inspired my interest in analytical storytelling
* Maps can be an important visualization tool but can be even more powerful when narrated and guided
* My Express.js setup is a relatively simple way to learn js and webdev without jumping into frameworks
