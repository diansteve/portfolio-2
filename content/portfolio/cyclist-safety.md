Is there a relationship between bike path access and cyclist injuries?

#### What it is:  
* An analysis of cyclist injuries and deaths in NYC
* Data collected from NYPD accident reports from 2012-present
* Multiple sources combined for further insight 

#### What I did:  
* Collected data through Socrata open data platform
* Processed and summarized for meaningful analysis 
* Combined accident data with bike path data
* Assessed whether proximity to a bike path predicted injury

#### What I learned:  
* Geospatial analysis
  + Simple Features
  + Map projections
  + Map transformations
  + Point-data aggregation
  + Geometric operations (conditional distance measurement)
* Visualization tools
  + Plotly
  + Gganimate
  + Leaflet
  + Mapdeck

#### Why it interests me:  
* Carbon-neutral transport is important to climate change aversion
* Cyclist safety is a key factor in adoption (and a public health issue)
* Geospatial data in social science can answer novel questions
* Learning methods I otherwise would not use broadens my skillset
