#### What it is:  
* A social psychology lab directed by [**Janet Swim**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JQSxXl8AAAAJ&hl=en)
* Focused on modeling and facilitating pro-environmental behavior
* Experimental studies occuring both in and out of the lab setting

#### What I did:  
* Reviewed literature to identify outcome measures for replication studies
* Proposed a study to a town council testing science-based justifications for renewable energy adoption  
* Led participants through studies
  + Fish Simulation Study: Lab study testing whether anger leads to increased competitiveness in commons dilemmas
  + Nature Walk Study: Outdoor study testing whether exposure to natural environments reduces self-focused thoughts
* Facilitated data collection 
  + Walked participants through informed consent
  + Maintained consistency in experience for data integrity
  + Built cover story to improve data quality by increasing competitiveness

#### What I learned:  
* [**CITI IRB/Human Subjects Research Certification**](https://about.citiprogram.org/en/series/human-subjects-research-hsr/)
* Literature Review  
* Scientific Communication
* Study Facilitation 
  + Informed Consent
  + Data Security
  + Data Collection
  + Subject pool assignment 

#### Why it interests me:  
* Meaningful climate change aversion must come from behavioral and policy changes
* Understanding psychological or societal barriers to pro-environmental behavior can inform smarter policy 
* Contributing to a field in novel ways is rewarding and exciting
