#### What it is:  
* An animated map of subway lines in New York City 

#### What I did:  
* Downloaded data from open data platform
* Designed map and layers with exploration in mind  

#### What I learned:  
* Visualization tools  
  + Deck.gl
  + Mapbox

#### Why it interests me:  
* Deck.gl is a robust framework for large-scale spatial visualization
* Mapbox allows for more powerful map design than leaflet
* Mapdeck's new features let me create intuitive visualizations of datasets I have wanted to see in new ways
