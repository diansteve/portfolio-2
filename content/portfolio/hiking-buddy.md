#### What it is:  
* An AR (Augmented Reality) app that lets you see a tabletop map of your chosen hiking location in 3D
* A unique way to explore trails you have been on or want to understand before trying 

#### What I did:  
* Overlayed the standard Mapbox satellite map with relevant features in Mapbox Studio
* Used the TabletopAR scene in the Maps for Unity SDK 
* Built custom prefabs to show features like mountains in large floating text 
* Built the application to Android for use with ARCore

#### What I learned:  
* Mapbox
  + Mapbox Studio
  + Vector tiles
* Unity 3D
  + Maps for Unity SDK
  + Custom prefabs
  + Android development
  + Git LFS

#### Why it interests me:  
* Topographic maps don't always give an impressionable sense of scale when viewed in 2D
* Having a tactile and interactive view of terrain data allows for novel interactions with it
* Augmented Reality is a useful medium for exploring data, especially spatial
