# Personal Portfolio
A collection of my work and thoughts.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6f39d91b-a341-410d-9e49-62500ee395d1/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jasonbixon/deploys)

## How it's built
- [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)
- [Hugo](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme) 
- [Netlify](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html)
- [Distill for R Markdown for analysis posts](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/)

## Why that stack?
- Portfolio stack is simple, write all posts in Markdown
- Distill blog format gives as much control over visualization as possible with R Markdown
  + Full-page width for outputs like maps are compelling & engaging
